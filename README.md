jemul8
======

An object-oriented JavaScript x86 Emulator for Node.js and the browser.

jemul8 takes an object-oriented approach to emulation. Primarily an educational tool, it aims to provide
a detailed description of the internal workings of an IBM-compatible PC.

It is built using the easy-to-use language JavaScript, so it may be picked up and tweaked by even
the amateur programmer.

It aims to reflect computer science concepts, such as Fetch-Decode-Execute, in a largely abstract context,
although the only instruction set currently supported is Intel's IA-32/x86 architecture.

Simple example (AMD)
--------------------

```javascript
/*global define */
define({
    cache: false
}, [
    "jemul8"
], function (
    jemul8
) {
    "use strict";

    var environment = jemul8.getEnvironment(),
        emulator = jemul8.createEmulator({
            "cmos": {
                "bios": "docs/bochs-20100605/bios/BIOS-bochs-legacy"
            },
            "vga": {
                "bios": "docs/bochs-20100605/bios/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest"
            },
            "floppy": [{
                "driveType": "FDD_350HD",
                "diskType": "FLOPPY_1_44",
                "path": "boot/" + environment.getOption("flp"),
                "loaded": true
            }]
        });

    emulator.loadPlugin("canvas.vga.renderer");
    emulator.loadPlugin("keyboard.input");

    emulator.init().done(function () {
        emulator.run();
    });
});
```
